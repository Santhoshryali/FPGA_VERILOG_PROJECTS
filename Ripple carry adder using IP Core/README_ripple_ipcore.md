# Ripple Carry Adder Using Vivado IP Core on Spartan‑7 FPGA (XC7S50)

This project implements a Ripple Carry Adder using the Vivado IP Integrator on a Spartan‑7 XC7S50 FPGA. The design uses Xilinx-provided IP to build a multi-bit binary adder and connect it with physical I/O for demonstration.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open the project in Vivado with IP Integrator enabled
2. Review the IP block diagram and regenerate the output products
3. Synthesize, implement, and generate the `.bit` file
4. Use Hardware Manager to program the FPGA
5. Provide two binary numbers using switches; observe the output sum and carry using LEDs
